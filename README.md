JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It achieves this by adding new HTML elements while modifying existing ones.

Many coders enhance web development skills using JavaScript to create user-friendly and interactive websites. With this programming language, front-end developers build elements like image carousels, games, and countdowns.

Brendan Eich invented JavaScript in 1995 to add interactivity to webpages. JavaScript is a text-based, client-side programming language.

"Client-side" means code executes on the user's computer, rather than on the server. This makes JavaScript load faster than server-side languages like PHP or ASP.

Most web browsers run JavaScript to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, and animate images. Coders use it to build games, calculators, and other programs for websites.

Stack Overflow Developerâ€™s Survey respondents rate JavaScript as the most popular language for building front-end web applications. JavaScript's popularity is due in part to being relatively easy to learn and implement.
